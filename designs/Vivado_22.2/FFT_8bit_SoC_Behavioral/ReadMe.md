I will input x32 old VHDL code, I will rewrite in System Verilog, and then back to VHDL

I will try to keep all files in the project, but all will be references anyway, except the IPs (multiplier and RAM)
I will use this project to import the IPs to the other designs


I don't know at which part of development you find this, but at the end there must be the old VHDL code folder,
and a new VHDL and System Verilog folder
