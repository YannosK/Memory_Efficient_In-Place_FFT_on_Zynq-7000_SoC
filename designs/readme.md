This directory contains all the HDL designs for this project. The source code is split into two folders: [`vhdl_code/`](./vhdl_code/) contains the code that was written in VHDL of the initial design, while [`sv_code/`](./sv_code/) contains the System Verilog code. The folders `fft_8bit` contain code where the memory word is 32 bits and the operations have a datum of 8 bit as their bases. Folders `fft_16bit` are architectures with 64-bit memory word and 16-bit data word length. All the folders that end with `tb` have testbench code.

In this directory all the Vivado projects are also stored. They are stored in directories depending on the version of the Vivado that they use. Currently there is only the directory [`Vivado_22.2`](./Vivado_22.2/).
