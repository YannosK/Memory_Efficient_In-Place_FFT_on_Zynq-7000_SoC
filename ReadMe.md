Here I will start developing my own FFT SoC application. It will be designed to operate with Cora Z7S

# TO-DO

## scripts
- [ ] many dependencies in paths
- [ ] need of more verastile twiddle generation (you already have one file but use it)
  - [x] I think I did something

## designs
### VHDL rewrite
- [ ] something wrong with the block RAM. Try to make it similar to [this]("D:/Yannos/FILES/PROGRAMS/FPGA/SoC/FFT/designs/Vivado_22.2/FFT_8bit_SoC_Baremetal/FFT_8bit_SoC_Baremetal.srcs/sources_1/imports/FFT_x32_vhdl_code/top_level_FFT_IP.vhd")
